Create your own glossary of hot-linked terms, inside your own site!

== Description ==

Build a glossary on your site, and link terms in your posts to it.

Reasons for using wp-glossary plugin:

* External glossary sites don't have all the words and terms you need.
* You want to keep your visitors on your site (not send them to an external glossary site).
* You don't want the adverts that the external site popups come with.

Keep your visitors on your site, keep their experience consistent and pleasant using *your* theme.

Once activated you add glossary terms (custom post type) and link to those terms from inside your own content using the powerful WordPress shortcode functionality.

== Installation ==

Either install through admin panel (this is the eaiest way), or:

1. Upload `wp-glossary.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Unzip the archive
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

If you create your own single template for glossary terms, don't forget to remove the reference filter.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin create any new tables? =

No. It uses custom post types and taxonomies.

= Can I link it to an external glossary =

Yes. As of version 1.2 you can add a reference title and link.

= None of the details pages are working! =

Please resave your rewrite rules: Settings > Permalinks > Save Changes (just click the button)

= It doesn't do anything? =

You have to add the terms (Glossary Terms > Add New Term) and then use [shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode).
I've listed a bunch on my website: [WP Glossary - Basic Shortcde Usage](http://www.tcbarrett.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-glossary/wp-glossary-basic-usage-of-the-glossary-shortcode/)
